# 🛍️ Icon Shop — Reimagined with Modern Tools

This project is a rebuild of my original [Icon Shop](https://icon-shop.es/) website, originally created using plain HTML and Vanilla JavaScript. The new version leverages modern technologies including:

- React
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- CSS3
- RTK Query
- Jest & Testing Library

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal is to enhance the website with:

- Modern tools and best practices
- A cleaner structure and maintainable codebase
- SEO optimization with server-side rendering (SSR)
- Client-side caching and improved performance
- Full-stack capabilities using Next.js
- Fully tested, production-ready components

This project is both a professional challenge and a passion project. I'm using it to deepen my skills while creating something meaningful. If you'd like to reach out, feel free to email me at **ianmng1@gmail.com**.

## 🎨 Design Approach

I'm using CSS3 (no frameworks) to recreate and improve the original design. This iteration aims to fix minor design issues from the first version while keeping the layout:

- Modern and clean
- Accessible
- Mobile-friendly
